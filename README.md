# Weather Application
It was created using the open APIs: open-meteo.com and geocode.maps.co
> Demo Link: https://babashov-weather-app.netlify.app/


There are no instructions for installing the application. Simply install the code and run it in a web browser. It is written using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The APIs I used are completely free and do not require any payments as of October 5, 2024.
